Graduating Components from Experimental
=======================================

This document contains a checklist for the requirements to migrate a component from experimental.

- [ ] The crate should fully conform with the [ICU4X Style Guide](style_guide.md):
  - [ ] The crate should have a complete library header as shown in [boilerplate.md](boilerplate.md) with Clippy passing
  - [ ] The names of exported types should conform to the recommendations in the Style Guide
  - [ ] All Error types should be `Copy`
  - [ ] All constructors should take options structs by value
  - [ ] All constructors should take arguments in the following order: Provider, Locale, Options
  - [ ] All constructors should have `_unstable`, `_with_any_provider`, and `_with_buffer_provider` overloads
  - [ ] Runtime dependencies should be minimal and able to be disabled with Cargo features if possible
- [ ] The data structs should fully follow ZeroVec style
  - [ ] Deserialization should not have a "net violation" in the [verify-zero-copy](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x/blob/main/provider/datagen/tests/verify-zero-copy.rs) test
  - [ ] Constructors should avoid allocating memory in the common case
  - [ ] Opaque blobs of data should be avoided if possible (instead use VarZeroVec, ZeroMap, etc.)
  - [ ] Data structs should not be panicky and conform to [data_safety.md](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x/blob/main/docs/design/data_safety.md)
- [ ] The component should be fuly integrated with ICU4X tooling
  - [ ] There should be an overview Criterion benchmark
  - [ ] There should be individual Criterion benchmarks for interesting or performance critical code paths
  - [ ] There should be at least one example plumbed with the icu_benchmark_macros
  - [ ] The component should be fully covered by FFI
- [ ] The component should encourage i18n best practices
  - [ ] The component should produce correct results in all locales as generated by icu4x-datagen
  - [ ] Where applicable, the component should be consistent with ECMA-402 and UTS #35
  - [ ] The API design should receive sign-off from a non-ICU4X i18n expert such as Markus Scherer
